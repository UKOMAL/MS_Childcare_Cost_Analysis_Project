        <h3>How We Analyzed the Data</h3>
        <p>To ensure accuracy and meaningful insights, we:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Adjusted all costs to 2018 dollars for fair comparison</li>
            <li>Combined data from state and federal sources</li>
            <li>Cross-checked our findings with state reports</li>
            <li>Tested relationships between different factors</li>
            <li>Implemented a multi-step imputation approach for missing values:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>First attempt: Use exact values from the state and year when available</li>
                <li>Second attempt: Use the mean from the same state across different years</li>
                <li>Third attempt: For states with completely missing data (notably Indiana and New Mexico), derive values from neighboring states</li>
                <li>Final attempt: Use the national mean for any remaining missing values</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Calculated derived metrics including annual costs, cost burden as a percentage of median household income, and working parent ratios</li>
            <li>Applied consistent visualization approaches using cubehelix color palettes for improved readability and aesthetic consistency</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="key-finding">
        <h3>Data Quality Considerations</h3>
        <p>Our analysis addressed several data challenges:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The original dataset contained significant missing data in key childcare columns (31.7% missing for center-based care)</li>
            <li>States like Indiana and New Mexico required special handling due to missing data</li>
            <li>For Indiana, we utilized data from neighboring states including Illinois ($2,920), Kentucky ($1,530), Michigan ($1,897), and Ohio ($1,857)</li>
            <li>For New Mexico, we incorporated data from Arizona ($1,900), Colorado ($2,713), Oklahoma ($1,999), and Texas ($1,310)</li>
            <li>Our careful imputation process ensured these states were properly represented while maintaining analytical integrity</li>
